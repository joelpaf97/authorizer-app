============== Technical and Architectural Decisions ==============

*Technology Choices*

Node.js and Express: I chose Node.js for its efficiency in non-blocking I/O and Express to simplify route configuration, which also simplifies server execution.

JavaScript Across the Stack: A single language in both frontend and backend for better coherence and code reuse.

HTML/CSS: To ensure compatibility and accessibility across all browsers. I am also familiar with using it extensively for client/server applications.



*System Architecture*

Client-Server Model: I used this model because it is common and required for this system, plus it is easier to maintain.

RESTful API: Uses APIs that provide a clear interface between the client and the server, allowing each part to evolve independently.

Middleware in Express: Manages the application's state and user sessions securely and efficiently.
